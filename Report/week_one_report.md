# The following are summary for  this week 
## Machine Learning
 Machine learnig.Machine is the science of programinga computer so they can learn from data.
 The application of machine learning
## ML applications
As an exciting and fast-moving field ML has many applications.
Computer vision: Object Classification in Photograph, image
 captioning.
 Speech recognition, Automatic Machine Translation,
 Communication systems
 Robots learning complex behaviors:
 Recommendations services (predict interests (Facebook), predict other
books you might like (Amazon), .
 Medical diagnosis.
 ## Types of Machine Learning Systems
* Supervised learning in supervised learning on this deal with dataset which has input and solute.
Learn a model from a given set of input-output pairs, in order topredict the output of new inputs 
Further grouped into Regression and classification problems.
* Unsupervised Learning on this discover patterns and learn the structure of unlabelled data.
Example Distribution modeling and Clustering .On this you have input but your hav no output
* Reiforcement Learning learn what actions to take in a given situation, based on
rewards and penalties. More details on RL 
# INSTALLATION OF ANACONDA
Before insatall anaconda first go to the download the anaconda either for window ,linus or mac.
This is an open source  after download install anaconda ,atfer complete to install go to the 
jupyper notebook and open will open browser .To test your installation, in your Terminal window 
or Anaconda Prompt, run the command conda list.For a successful installation, 
a list of installed packages appears.

# An introduction to Objects and their Classes in python
on pytho is deffer from other language because when you want to declare a  variable does not need 
to write a data type of that varible and also in pytho use space in write method and condition
statement .but on call are simillar to other programing language.and also in
python small line of code have large impart of code compare to other language.on this introduction
learnt about means of Abstraction how to build complex units,Python Classes and instance variables
Inheritance and Polymorphism ,Calling a superclasses initializer and interfaces
### Numpy Basics,pandas and other package
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. Provide high-performance
vector, matrix and higher-dimensional data structures and offers Matlab-ish capabilities within Python
It contains among other things a powerful N-dimensional array/vector/matrix object,
function implementation in C/Fortran assuring good performance if vectorized tools for 
integrating C/C++ and Fortran code useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random
number capabilities
## Model Evaluation and Improvement
# Cross-Validation
* Cross-validation is a statistical method of evaluating generalization performance that is more stable 
and thorough than using a split into a training and a test set. In crossvalidation, the data is instead split 
repeatedly and multiple models are trained. The
most commonly used version of cross-validation is k-fold cross-validation, where k is
a user-specified number, usually 5 or 10.
## Data visualization and feature engeeniering
In this section you will learn how to make a cursory investigation about the different data and provide your observations.
On this the method which used for vizulaztion were histogram chart and correlatio and scattered.
* Feature engeeniering
 thi involeve the feture selection and feature extraction.On this feature selected accoding to the the visulazation was done
 the feature do not be selected by eyes.And feature which do not be expected to get big result will be droped.And also before 
 the feture be selected first lock for missig the value in feature ,their two method of fixed mixed data first is drop and second 
 is fill but on filled you can filled the mean of that value or place zero value.
## Model - based feature Selection : Using SelectFromModel
On this method  the model is is used to select the feature for the train the system the  SelectFromModel this is class which 
pass the model for do the selection of feture.
## Model selection
The selection of model it depend on number of features, the complex of the data and typing of machine learning such
supervised or unsupervized. on supervized can use classificatio or regressor model such 
* Linear Regression
* Random Forest regressor
* Decision tree regressor
* k-Neighbors classification,
* Linear models for classification
