# weekly report for pytz ipt 2018
The machine learning industrial train at cive at the University of Dodoma started on 30 th jully.This ipt deal with  train student about
machine learning and deep learning .But on the first week  on the day one they was introduction of individual members of ipt  and discuss 
which  things shall curver on Ipt period.And also we arranged the time for study,presentation and discussion. On this Ipt shall plan study 
to understand machine laerning and deep learning and after thatevery member of this ipt  to understand diffent algorithm and
to develop project about machine learning or deep learning.


 On the first week study about machine learning , the machine learning  learnt  bout how comuputer is programming  with a data 
 and perfoming a certain task.The machine learnig predict a data by applying the algorithm but not all the algorithm can solve
 the problem .The algorithm is used according to the natural of data .On machine learning can be classified according to amount
 of data or type data which will used on train.The data can be categorical or numerical.On this introduction of machine learning 
 ,the machine learning divide into three namely supervised learning , unsupervised learnig and reinfoecement learning. But on 
 supervised learning descover that the data which used to learning must be have inpute and output but on unsupervised does not 
 has an output.


 Apart from learning introduction of machine learnig their various chapter has studed about machine learning ,feature selection, model
selection and model evaluation.On feture selection understand that the teature can to be select by eye instead of using either 
feature-base model selection of vizulazation of data.And also on model selection model must be selected according to the feature and 
the amount of the data.

on the model be select to understand more is Random Forest, the random forest is one of ensembles of decision trees  on esembles 
of decision tree are the method which invole combination of model to form more powerful model.Random forest is best decause this model
reduce the problem of overfitting by reduce anumber of n_estimato mean the number of tree selected.On this model does not well
performing on high dimension,sparse.

On a middle of the week discussed about the project which shall do on the final of ipt.The project which discussed was General purpose
Recommendation system eng.we discuss about the meaning of the project and tools which will use and time used to do the project.

Their some challenge face me during learning beacuse  at the first time to learning machine learnig it take alot of time to understand
the terminology of machine learnig.And also their several task on read for short time period.BUt after discover this challenge 
they decide to change the way of study from indivudual learnin chapter and divide charpter into groups of person and also in case of study
we introduced presentation in older to understand more for ask question and provided answers.
